# ScalpCV
A scalping bot utilizing OpenCV to maintain consistency across websites, slow and steady scalps the web

This was/is a school project designed by a trio of nerds in the span of about a week of work time to be an incredibly basic scalping bot

We built ScalpCV mainly for a simple way for us to combat midnight releases of products that go out of stock hella fast like the Switch 2 pre-orders (we wanna sleep, not spam refresh)

# TO DO:
- Properly comment code -.-
- Integrate email to openCV build

# Stretch goals:
- Run recursively and automatically
- Docker containerization
- Multiple instances managed in the same container
- Use unGoogled chromium for browser
- Web interface
- Home assistant integration
- Secure automated payment
- Configure when to run depending on time
- Refreshing pages for midnight drops
- Have Harsh contribute something
